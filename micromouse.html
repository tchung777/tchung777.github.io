						<p>
						The Micromouse project was for a competition hosted by IEEE where you build a robotic mouse to solve a 16x16 grid maze.
						To solve it, you have to get to the center of the maze and then back track to your starting spot. The robot needs
						to take less than 10 minutes to complete this.
						You could not fly, destroy, or use the top of the walls as markings.
						So obviously there was some design restraints and tech specifications we had to follow.
						<br>
						This was the first serious project I took on outside of lab work. That year, our team consisted of four sophomores, including 
						myself. Of the four, three of us were CSE/EE and the remaining one was an EE. I was a CSE/EE but we were all the same: none of us 
						knew how to handle a serious technical project outside of labs and this was the first one we would encounter that would challenge
						us (well some of us. I can't say <i>all</i> of our members work that hard or contributed much.)
						<br>
						We attempted to tackle the problem first by implementing the software on a LEGO NXT robot. This was our first mistake - and I 
						meant solving the software. Looking back with all the benefits of hind sight, I realized that we should have attempted to build
						the hardware while simultaneously implementing the software. The LEGO NXT was neither the robot we were going to compete with
						nor did it have the actual ability to do accurate right hand turns for our software. But with our CSE dominated team, we foolishly
						thought "Of course we're going to solve this!" During this portion of the project, I conveyed to my team member the algorithm
						that we used to solved the problem. Some of my team members might incorrectly tell you that we used Djikstra's A* but this is not
						true. A* was far too complicated for us.
						We used a form of Depth First Search where the "graph" was molded into a 16x16 graph interconnected together. Each square of grid
						was given a number: this was an arbitrary way to give weight/preference to squares we wanted to go. Whether we could actually
						go there was up to whether there were walls or not. The algorithm was as follow: we always start at one of the corners of
						the maze. This was corner 0. We scan around us for available squares that were accessible. If there were, then by default we start
						by putting lower numbers into a stack so that the higher numbers are what's accessible on top. We pop the top and then proceed
						to go there. We put that number into an array that is meant to represent our history. We keep doing this until we hit
						a road block. Then we back track into our history and erase the square we were in. We pop the stack to go take the 
						alternative that we didn't take before. We keep doing this until we get to the center. Since we assigned a number to 
						each square, we know what number the middle 4 squares should be. We use our history array to backtrack back to square 0.
						We have then completed the maze.
						<br>
						It took us a quarter to complete the software and it still wasn't necessarily reliable. We only have half a quarter left to build
						the hardware before the competition. For the robot, we ended up using motors and encoders from Solarbotics. We prototyped a robot
						using Arduino, breadboard, wires, two DC motors, two encoders, and IR sensors. One obstacle we immediately ran into was realizing
						that mounting our motors onto a platform and attempting to drive the robot did not result in the robot moving straight. If
						we couldn't go straight or turn right accurately, our software was useless. I spent an extensive amount of time learning about
						PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controllers to make our robot go straight. I ran into great difficulties trying to tune
						the parameters. Initially, I attempted to plot out the distance seen by each wheel and tune the parameters to that. After
						consulting one of the graduate students at our school,  I came to realized I needed to tune to the velocity of each wheel
						instead because as the distance grows, the controller becomes unbounded. Velocity stays relatively constant, so it was better to 
						use that to tune the PID parameters. 
						My experiments with velocity still resulted in unstable performance despite my numerous attempts to tune the output curve.
						It turns out ultimately, one PID isn't enough. I needed a PID controller on each wheels and have both be approaching
						a desired velocity. This was how we ultimately perfected linear acceleration.
