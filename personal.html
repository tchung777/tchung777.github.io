				<blockquote>"The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed."
				<br>-William Gibson
				</blockquote>
				<p>
				Growing up in the Bay Area, I have always been exposed to various facets of technology.
				As someone who was exposed to 90s cultural during a young age, 
				I was always fascinated by the future portrayed in cartoons and their depictions of what
				things might be.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, as I grew into an adolescent, I felt that me and my generation started developing
				a cynical view of the future and that we would never get the flying hoverboard and cars,
				that we would never have spaceships to take us to the stars,
				that we would never have giant robots,
				and that the best we'll ever have are hoverboards with wheels (whatever that is),
				fidget spinners, 
				and phones for memes.
				<br><br>
				But when I got into college and I started working at various high-tech companies,
				I was proud to see some of the notable efforts by those working on the latest and greatest,
				putting their sweat, blood and tears into working on things they loved and cared about.
				It made me realize that the future we dreamed of was not impossible.
				The technology was already there, just that it was as Gibson said, "unevenly distributed."
				As such, that observation has driven me to pursue STEM topics and continue to better myself
				everyday in order to help strive for the future that we once envisioned as kids. 
				Because if we as a generation aren't striving to build that future, then no one will.
				<br><br>
				There are three key areas that I strive to work on everyday through my hobbies.

									<h3>Physical Health</h3>
									<p>
										I believe eating right and staying physically active is an important part of being what I dubbed the 'Renaissance Man'.
										I'm a fan of most sports, although I particularly like basketball,
										tennis, and badminton. Being from the Bay, I'm a fan of the Golden
										State Warriors. Besides sports, I'm also a novice dabbler in rock
										climbling.

									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p>
										I believe that creating art is the gateway to innovation.
										I'm an amateur in guitar playing and by no means do 
										I make music. But I enjoy good music and I'm certainly
										envious of those who can make it their craft. I hope to one
										day getting started on playing the ukulele but before that I hope
										to reach an adequate level in guitar playing. My (current) favorite
										song of all time is "Castle On the Hill" by Ed Sheeran.

									<h3>Practicality</h3>
									<p>
										As a way to further my creative play, I often work on engineering
										projects to help enhance my understanding of the world. I also
										work on engineering projects because I like them. If I'm not working,
										I'm probably working on an engineering project involving microcontrollers, PCB design, laser cutting, and 3D printing.
										Perhaps my biggest weakness is the fact that I sometime can't help but
										stay up working on a project that I can't stop putting my hands on.
